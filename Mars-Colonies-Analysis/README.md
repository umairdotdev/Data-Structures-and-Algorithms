# Mars Colonies Analysis Project

This project analyzes the geographic and demographic dynamics of four Martian colonies: Yharnam, Marsdrid, Ironforge, and Churroland. It includes calculations of distances, risk assessments, and evacuation strategies based on hypothetical scenarios.

## Features

- **Distance Calculations**: Functions to compute distances between landmarks.
- **Risk Analysis**: Identify cities at risk from volcanic activity.
- **Evacuation Planning**: Evaluate and optimize evacuation strategies.
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Explore solutions backed by computational results.

## How to Use

1. Open the `Mars-Colonies-Analysis.ipynb` file to explore the analysis.
2. Run the cells in the notebook to see calculations and results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Standard Python libraries (e.g., `math`)

Feel free to modify and adapt the project for your own learning and exploration.
